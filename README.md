# League_of_Legends_Metrics_Viewer
What we want to create is a web application made for League of Legends players. Our application, the "League of Legends Matchup Calculator," or LOLMC, is a user-friendly tool that would calculate and predict team matchups based on extensive historical champion data, including strengths, weaknesses, performance statistics, and synergy between each champion. Users of the app can input their team composition, and then our application can analyze the matchup against their opponents, and look at factors such as lane dominance, jungle control, team fight capability, and late-game scaling to see which side is more likely to win.

The application will provide both a percentage-based win prediction and insights for strategy adjustments. "League of Legends Matchup Calculator" serves as a resource for new players looking to gain a slight competitive edge, allowing them to make informed decisions on champion picks and bans. Whether preparing for ranked play, tournaments, or casual games with friends, this web application is a great tool for any League of Legends player aiming to enhance their understanding of team dynamics and increase their win rate.
